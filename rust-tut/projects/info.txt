## Hello world
=> Rust uses .rs extension
=> Create file hello_world.rs 
=> Rust entry point is function named main
=> function is written as:

> fn function_name() {}

=> Rust main function will be:
> fn main() {}

=> Hello world in Rust:

> fn main() {
    println!("Hello World");
  }

=> Use println! to print text on screen.
=> println! calls Rust macro, using ! means calling macro instead of normal function.
=> Marco don't always follow the same rule as functions.
=> To call function we would've used just println without '!'.

=> To Rust file first we need to compile it.
=> Use rustc to compile Rust file.

> rustc hello_world.rs

=> After compiling Rust compiler will create 2 files on windows and 1 files in linux/macos.
=> All linux, macos and windows will have ".exe" file that's binary executable.
=> And windows will create additional file ".pdb" that contains debugging information.
=> Run hello_world.exe

> ./hello_world.exe // for linux and macos
> .\hello_world.exe // for windows
